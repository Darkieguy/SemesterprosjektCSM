  <h2 class="h2-text"> Support<br><br></h2>
  <p1 class="p1-text">
    There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an 
    important way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community. <br><br>

  You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections.<br> 
  If you have some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our <br>
  Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.

  <h2 class="h2-text"> Volunteer<br><br></h2>
  <p1 class="p1-text">
  A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and <br>
  ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind <br>
  the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all <br>
  staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.<br><br>

  You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find <br>
  out more about how you can get involved.
  </p1>
