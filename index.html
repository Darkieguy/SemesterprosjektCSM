    Explore together <br><br>
    Come join us at the Community Science Museum where 
    we’re committed to making science accessible to all.<br><br>
    Over the course of human history, science has developed 
    from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and 
    earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to 
    the very building blocks of life itself.

  <p1 class="index-text p1-text">
    The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can 
    experience the wonders of our discoveries<br> 
    and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of 
    the world around us.<br><br>
    We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, 
    but brought to live through exhibits.<br> 
    This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of 
    science to explore.<br><br>
    Many of these exhibits are designed for 
    you to interact with and play around to see science come to life<br> 
    (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to 
    life at night when everyone’s gone home).
